<h1> <strong>Image-Gallery</strong></h1>
<h2> An Image Gallery website with the following functionalities :- </h2>

- Form with URL and alt fields plus a submit button.

- On submit, the image appears in the gallery.

- Delete button below each image removes it immediately.

- Newest image appears at the top (we reverse the array when rendering).

- Local storage integration: images are loaded from storage on page load, and saved whenever updated.

- Editing enabled via an “Edit” button using prompt() dialogs

# Note : The code in modals branch uses modals instead of prompt() inputs for editing the url and alt text
